# Getting Started

## 1. Educate Yourself
Privacy is having the agency to decide when you reveal personal information. It is a particularly valuable quality today, when the collection and storage of personal data is taking place at unprecedented levels. We are in an age where data is of high value, and Beldex aims to equip individuals with tools to obfuscate their information and interactions with the internet. Protecting your data keeps power on your side.

Beldex's privacy tools offer free communication by incentivising indviduals through its cryptocurrency block reward to keep the network private, secure and untraceable. 

Before you start using Beldex, you should [educate yourself](../Introduction/BeldexNetwork.md) on how Beldex will help you obfuscate your data.

## 2. Choose Your Wallet
The Beldex wallets are a gateway into private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold private keys, secure Beldex, stake Beldex and trade peer-to-peer. 

If you are unsure about which wallet to choose, you should go to the [Which Wallet To Use](../Wallets/WhatWalletToUse.md) page.

## 3. Acquire Beldex
Beldex can be purchased on exchanges(currently listed on BTC-Alpha and STEX) with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

You can also aquire Beldex by [mining](../Mining/MiningOverview.md). Mining is the process of extracting Beldex for securing and verifying transactions made on the blockchain.

## 4. Stake and Earn Beldex
Once you own Beldex you can consider staking it to the network to receive additional Beldex by running a Master Node with peers or by yourself. 

To operate a [Master Node](../MasterNodes/MNOverview.md), an operator [time-locks a significant amount of Beldex](../MasterNodes/StakingRequirement.md) and provides a minimum level of bandwidth and storage to the network. In return for their services, Beldex Master Node operators receive a portion of the [block reward](../Advanced/Cryptoeconomics.md) from each block.
