## Wallets
Wallets offer a gateway to private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold, secure and trade Beldex with peers. [Download the official Beldex wallet](https://github.com/beldex-coin/beldex/releases/latest) today and start taking back control of your online privacy.

To learn more about wallets, [click here](../Wallets/WalletsOverview.md).

Confused with which wallet to use? Check out the "[Which wallet to use?](../Wallets/WhatWalletToUse.md)" guide.


## Master Nodes
Beldex utilises a network of [Master Nodes](../MasterNodes/MNOverview.md) which are paid to propagate the blockchain and process transactions. Master Nodes require a [collateral](../MasterNodes/MNOverview.md) of Beldex to be active, and this creates a built-in market-based Sybil resistance by forcing actors to incur a large cost in attempting any form of temporal analysis on the network.

## Advanced
Learn more about Beldex by browsing through the Advanced section. Topics that are covered are: [Technical Specs](../Advanced/TechnicalSpecs.md), [Dynamic Block Size](../Advanced/DynamicBlockSize.md) and the [CryptoNote Elements](../Advanced/CryptoNoteElements.md) used by Beldex.
