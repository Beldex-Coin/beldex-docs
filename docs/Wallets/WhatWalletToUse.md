# Which wallet to use?

The Beldex wallets are a gateway into private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold private keys and secure, mine, stake or trade Beldex. Each wallet is designed specifically for different users depending on their goal and level of expertise.

The different wallets currently available are the:

- Graphical user interface wallet (GUI) 

- Command-line interface wallet (CLI)

- Mobile wallet

- Web wallet

## Use cases

Before deciding which wallet you want to use, you must first know what you want the wallet for.

### Receiving and sending Beldex

All Beldex wallets can receive and send Beldex, however some are much easier to use for this specific purpose.

The easiest wallets to use for sending and receiving Beldex are:

- Mobile wallet

 The GUI wallet can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/beldex-coin/beldex-electron-gui-wallet/releases)<!--, while the mobile wallet can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. -->

### Hosting a Master Node as an Operator

If you want to host and operate a Beldex Master Node, there is only one wallet that offers the ability to register a Master Node: the command-line interface wallet (CLI) which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/beldex-coin/beldex/releases).

To better understand how to prepare, register and maintain a Master Node, check out this guide [here](../MasterNodes/MNFullGuide.md).

### Staking to a Master Node as a contributor.

Do you have at least 25% of a Beldex Master Node staking requirement, and want to contribute to a Master Node pool?

If so, you will want to either use the:

- Graphical user interface wallet (GUI) - Currently under development, or the

- Command-line interface wallet (CLI)

You can download the cli-wallet from [here](https://github.com/beldex-coin/beldex/releases)
<!-- If you rarely use the terminal or command line, we would suggest to perform your stake through the GUI wallet which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/beldex-coin/beldex-electron-gui-wallet/releases). Alternatively, if you would like to perform the stake on the CLI wallet, you can download it [here](https://github.com/beldex-coin/beldex/releases). -->
