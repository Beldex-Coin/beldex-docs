# Restoring Your CLI Wallet from Keys

If you have a Mnemonic Seed Phrase, restoring your wallet from it would probably be a good option. Otherwise, you can restore your wallet from private keys. You will need to have the following keys to proceed:

- Wallet public address
- Spend Key
- View Key

## Step 1: Download and unzip CLI wallet

- Download the latest release of wallet CLI software for your desired operating system: https://github.com/beldex-coin/be/reldex/releases
- Unzip  `beldex-[operating-system]-[platform]-[version].zip` file

## Step 2: Run wallet in restore mode

- Open a [Command Prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) (Windows) or [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) (Linux / OSX) and navigate to the wallet folder

- Run wallet with `--generate-from-keys`  argument: 

`./beldex-wallet-cli --generate-from-keys [New Wallet Name]`

Where `[New Wallet Name]` is a new wallet name. You can enter any name here, use something rememberable and meaningful. 

## Step 3: Enter wallet address, view and spend keys

On the next step, specify all 3 wallet keys, one by one:

- Enter **Standard address** and press [Enter]
- Enter **Secret spend key** and press [Enter]
- Enter **Secret view key** and press [Enter]

## Step 4: Enter wallet password

- You will be prompted for a password. Enter a new password that follows the [Password Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_policy) and press [Enter].

- Confirm password and press [Enter].

## Step 5: Specify a blockchain height

If you know the block height at which wallet was created or a first transaction was made, you can enter it here. Specifying a blockchain height will help to scan the wallet faster.

If you don't know a specific blockchain height, press [Enter] for scanning from block height 0.

## Step 6: Wait for the refresh process to finish

For refresh process to start, you need to have your daemon running. Another option would be to use a remote node. For that, use the following command, replacing <host> and <port> with the host and port number of the remote node you are connecting to:

```
./beldex-wallet-cli --daemon-address <host>:<port>
```

Once refresh is done, you can use your full functioning restored wallet. Your public wallet address will remain the same.
